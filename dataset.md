The dataset used in this demo is a subset of the ImageNet dataset (100 classes, 10 images for each class), and the dataset is available via <a href="https://github.com/towhee-io/examples/releases/download/data/reverse_image_search.zip"> Github. </a>

The dataset is organized as follows:

train: directory of candidate images;
test: directory of test images;
reverse_image_search.csv: a csv file containing an id, path, and label for each image;
